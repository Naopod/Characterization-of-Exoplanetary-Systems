# Characterization-of-Exoplanetary-Systems
Project realized during my Master 2 297 in Paris-Dauphine University, as part of the Computer Science class.

I conducted a statistical analysis of exoplanets, as well as their host stars, and tried modelling the habitability and potential new host stars. I used both Python and R, and did two regression tasks, comparing different state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, and setting up a simple neural network on Pytorch. I did two classification tasks, the second one being treated as a semi-supervised learning problem, through the use of One-Class SVM.

A beginning of spatial distribution analysis has been done on R, using the "spatstat" package, on hosting stars.
